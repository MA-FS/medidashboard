# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Web Framework:** Dash (by Plotly)
- **Charting Library:** Plotly.py
- **Database:** SQLite 3
- **Core Python Libraries:** `sqlite3` (built-in), `dash`, `plotly`, `pandas` (likely needed by Dash/Plotly or for data handling)

## Development Setup

- Requires Python 3 installation.
- Dependencies managed via `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file (to be created).
- Run application locally using a Python script (e.g., `python app.py`).
- Access via web browser at `http://localhost:8050` (default Dash port).

## Technical Constraints

- Runs locally, no cloud components.
- Designed for a single user at a time.
- Browser compatibility depends on Dash/Plotly support.

## Dependencies

- `dash`: Core web application framework.
- `plotly`: Interactive charting.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation (often used with Dash/Plotly).
