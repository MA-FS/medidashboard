# Project Brief: MediDashboard

## Core Goal

Develop a user-friendly, locally-run, web-based application (MediDashboard) for personal medical biomarker tracking. Users should be able to:
- Define custom biomarkers (name, unit, category).
- Record time-stamped readings for these biomarkers.
- Visualize biomarker trends interactively on a dashboard.
- Store data securely and locally using SQLite.
- Easily back up and restore the entire dataset.

This application aims to empower users to monitor their health data effectively on their own computer, accessible via a web browser.
